# Tmox (Terminal Monoplexer)

Tmox spawns a shell detached from the current terminal. The detached shell stays alive even after the terminal is closed. It's _almost_ equivalent to [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) that spawns multiple detached shells ("**multi**plexer"). Instead, Tmox detaches only _one_ shell; hence "**mono**plexer".
